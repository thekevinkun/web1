        <h2>DAILY LIFE</h2>
        <p>I spend most of my time walking around my housing are. 
            I'm smart enough to know when to go back home when arleady feel hungry.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I wasn't really good at fighting. Don't get me wrong, I'm strong, but just not good enough.
            There are a lot of crazy fighter Cat in this area in which makes me scare a lil' bit.
