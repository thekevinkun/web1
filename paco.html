            <p>I spend most of my time walking around my housing are. 
                I'm smart enough to know when to go back home when arleady feel hungry.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I wasn't really good at fighting. Don't get me wrong, I'm strong, but just not good enough.
                There are a lot of crazy fighter Cat in this area in which makes me scare a lil' bit.
